The Protection of Human Beings in the Use of Artificial Intelligence from the Perspective of International Laws and the Convention on Human Rights
Artificial intelligence (AI) has evolved rapidly in recent years, influencing all areas of human life, from medicine and economics to education and justice. This progress raises a number of fundamental questions about how to ensure that its development and implementation respect human rights. In this essay, two AI lawyers examine the intersection between the advancement of AI and the international legal framework, paying particular attention to the Convention on Human Rights. 

Impact of AI on Human Rights
The increasing use of AI has opened up new opportunities, but it has also raised concerns about the protection of fundamental rights. AI-based tools, handling huge amounts of data, can generate risks in areas such as privacy and freedom of expression, which leads us to review how these technologies align with regulations such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR).
One of the most relevant challenges is how to ensure that the massive use of data by AI respects the right to privacy of individuals. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR "AI ethics standards" and "accountability principles") in the European Union was established as a response to the risks posed by the automated processing of personal data. This regulation is a good example of how privacy can be protected in the digital age, but its effective implementation requires continuous effort and constant updating in the face of technological advances.

Legal and Ethical Challenges in AI Integration
One of the most complex dilemmas we face as AI lawyers is the question of liability when critical decisions are made by algorithms. A particularly sensitive example is the use of AI systems in the judicial field. While these technologies promise to improve objectivity and reduce human bias, they also present the risk of inheriting human biases, which could compromise the principle of equality before the law, enshrined in Article 7 of the UDHR.
One of the biggest challenges in integrating artificial intelligence is algorithmic bias, a phenomenon that occurs when AI systems reflect or amplify inherent biases in the data used to train them. This issue is especially concerning because, as we rely more on AI to make critical decisions in areas such as justice, job hiring, or resource allocation, any bias present can perpetuate pre-existing inequalities, compromising fundamental principles such as equality before the law. The apparent objectivity of AI can obscure the reality that these systems are not neutral, raising the urgent need to develop legal and ethical mechanisms that ensure fairness and transparency in their design and implementation. AI lawyers should be vigilant about these risks, as algorithmic bias can undermine rights enshrined in the Convention on Human Rights, such as non-discrimination and fair access to justice.
In the field of security and defense, the development of autonomous weapons raises a crucial question: Should AI have the ability to decide on a person's life or death? As jurists, we are obliged to reflect on the implications of this type of technology, since the autonomy of weapons can contradict international humanitarian law and the fundamental principles of the right to life. The United Nations has begun to address this issue, but the discussion is still in its early stages.

The Convention on Human Rights as an Ethical Framework
The European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) provides a valuable framework for assessing the impact of AI on human rights. This convention protects key rights such as privacy, the prohibition of torture and the right to a fair trial, all of which are particularly vulnerable to the misuse of AI.
For example, mass surveillance using AI is an area of great concern. Advanced facial recognition and tracking systems may violate the right to privacy, as set out in Article 8 of the ECHR. Technology lawyers should work to ensure that AI tools used in surveillance are properly regulated, in order to prevent abuses.

The Need for an International Legal Framework for AI
At the global level, there is an urgent need to establish an international legal framework that comprehensively addresses the challenges posed by AI. This framework should be based on fundamental principles enshrined in treaties such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and should be flexible enough to adapt to rapid technological advances.
An essential aspect that we jurists must consider is transparency and accountability in the use of autonomous systems. Developers and the companies that design these systems must be responsible for the consequences of their creations, especially when their decisions impact fundamental rights. The creation of AI ethics standards  and accountability principles  has already begun to take shape in various jurisdictions, but much remains to be done to establish uniform standards globally.

Conclusion
The transition of human beings to a society where artificial intelligence plays a central role is inevitable and complex. As lawyers specializing in this area, our responsibility is to ensure that this change respects human rights and international law. While AI offers enormous benefits, it also poses significant risks that need to be carefully managed.
The creation of a strong and coherent legal framework regulating the development and use of AI is essential to protect fundamental rights. Only through collaboration between experts in technology, ethics and law will we be able to meet the challenges posed by AI and, at the same time, harness its qualities for the benefit of all humanity.
